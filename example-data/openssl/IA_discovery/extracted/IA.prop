The following return values of SSL_connect_APIName can occur, 0, 1, <0
X509_get_notBefore_APIName and X509_get_notAfter_APIName were deprecated in OpenSSL 1.1.0
This alert is always fatal and should never be observed in communication between proper implementations
Only meaningful for client authentication
This is only meaningful for client authentication
Both BIO_gets_APIName and BIO_puts_APIName are supported
The supported protocols are SSLv2 , SSLv3 , TLSv1 , TLSv1 .1 and TLSv1 .2
This is needed as a workaround for some implementations
Only use this in explicit fallback retries , following the guidance in draft-ietf-tls-downgrade-scsv-00
DO NOT ENABLE THIS
Previous versions had to use
Do not use the SSLv3 protocol
Do not use the TLSv1 .1 protocol
At first the library must be initialized
it will never succeed !
for any cryptographic algorithm required by OpenSSL, it should be used
the SSL/TLS engine must parse the record , consisting of header and body
the random number generator must be seeded or the operation will fail.
this is no longer possible
the client must still use the same SSLv3 .1 = TLSv1 announcement
The SSLv3 protocol is deprecated and should not be used
The contents of a signed receipt should only be considered meaningful
SSLv2 does not support a shutdown alert protocol , so SSLv2 can only be detected , whether the underlying connection was closed
no certificates added using SSL_CTX_add_extra_chain_cert_APIName will be used
the SSL engine must know whether the SSL engine must call the connect or accept routines
Callers that only have `` const '' access to data they 're indexing in a table , yet declare callbacks without constant types , are creating their own risks/bugs without being encouraged to do so by the API
the extension type must not be handled by OpenSSL internally or an error occurs
The OpenSSL error strings should be loaded by calling ERR_load_crypto_strings_APIName or , for SSL applications , SSL_load_error_strings_APIName first
In new applications , SHA-1 or RIPEMD-160 should be preferred
One SSL_SESSION object , regardless of its reference count , must only be used with one SSL_CTX object
Applications which included workarounds for this bug should be modified to handle this fix or they may free up an already freed BIO
This mode should only be used to implement cryptographically sound padding modes in the application code
This kind of reference can be considered a specialised form of structural reference , - however to avoid difficult-to-find programming bugs , it is recommended to treat the two kinds of reference independently
nid_key and nid_cert are the encryption algorithms that should be used for the key and certificate respectively
The dynamic parent structure members should not be accessed
use SSL_CIPHER_description instead
Applications usually will not need to modify the embedded content as it is normally set by higher level functions
The equivalent with BIOs should not be used and may block as a result
The files are looked up by the CA subject name hash value , which must hence be available
EC_METHOD_get_field_type identifies what type of field the EC_METHOD structure supports , which will be either F2 ^ m or Fp
make sure that you also disable either all previous or all subsequent protocol versions
Clients should avoid creating `` holes '' in the set of protocols Clients support
An application just needs to add them
one should obtain a new reference
Do not use the TLSv1 protocol
The auto allocation feature only works on OpenSSL 0.9.7 and later
New programs should prefer the `` new '' style , whilst the `` old '' style is provided for backwards compatibility purposes
a SSL_read_APIName or SSL_write_APIName would return with -1 and indicate the need to retry with SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ
The SSLv2 and SSLv3 protocols are deprecated and should generally not be used
Do not use the SSLv2 protocol
The verify_callback function must be supplied by the application and receives two arguments
"0" has to be returned and no certificate will be sent
the extension must be different
func should be of type LHASH_DOALL_ARG_FN_TYPE
It is the job of the client_cert_cb to store information about the state of the last call
The verification callback can be used to customise the operation of certificate verification , either by overriding error conditions or logging errors for debugging purposes
Some old `` export grade '' clients may only support weak encryption using 40 or 64 bit RC2
Any code mixing the two will not work on all platforms
You might have to do the latter
the caller can either cast the `` const '' away or use the macros to declare/implement the wrapper functions without `` const '' types
the curve_name must also be set
For other types of BIO they may not be supported
the number of checks needs to be much higher to reach the same level of assurance
The extensions must be concatenated into a sequence of bytes
This can lead to unexpected behaviour
a new session is assigned a timeout value, after which a new session will not be accepted for session reuse.
Newer applications should just call
This should never happen
this is a bug
A frequent cause of problems is attempting to use the PEM routines like this
Attempts to use it on earlier versions will typically cause a segmentation violation
This will might lead to connection failures for a description of the method 's properties
attempting to set the key length to any value other than the fixed value is an error
release the memory we were using to hold it
The host can be can be '' '' which is interpreted as meaning any interface
A common mistake is to attempt to use a buffer directly as follows
Note , however , that these implementations are not available on all platforms
To enable this , the following is required
The second best solution to this problem is to set hash - > down_load = 0 before you start
As a result Some objects can not be encoded or decoded as part of ASN .1 structures
Other attributes are discarded
Prefer PKCS1_OAEP padding
In such case leakage would be minimal , it would take attacker 's ability to observe memory access pattern with byte granilarity as it occurs , post-factum timing analysis wo n't do
This can cause problems as the time_t value can overflow on some systems resulting in unexpected results
The public key is encoded using a SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure and an error occurs
The parameters and restrictions are identical to the encryption operations except that
These files can be converted into C code using the - C option of the dhparam application
the handshake will fail
an error condition occurred
A violation will cause the program to abort
BIO_puts is not supported
This will probably crash somewhere in d2i_X509
Some non-recoverable , fatal I/O error occurred
This case however is problematic
These are the general-purpose version-flexible SSL/TLS methods
This function may fail
This function has been implemented this way and because once you get into pulling bytes input bytes apart things get ugly !
Copies should be made or reference counts increased instead
This case should not occur
Additionally it indicates that the session ticket is in a renewal period and should be replaced
However , this return value should probably be ignored
The handshake routines may have to be explicitly set in advance using either SSL_set_connect_state_APIName or SSL_set_accept_state_APIName
The information must only be used for normal operation under non-blocking I/O
It is recommended to use the standard terminology
Some attributes such as counter signatures are not supported
It supports non blocking I/O
the server must use a DH group and generate a DH key
These can support arbitrary operations via ENGINE_ctrl_APIName , including passing to and/or from the control commands data of any arbitrary type
All other ciphers need a corresponding certificate and key
These commands are supported in the discovery mechanisms simply to allow applications determinie if an ENGINE supports certain specific commands it might want to use
RSA ciphers using DHE need a certificate and key and additional DH-parameters
KEKRecipientInfo structures need to be added
This is not thread safe but will never happen
The prime may have to fulfill additional requirements for use in Diffie-Hellman key exchange
the recipients certificate is needed to locate the appropriate recipients in the CMS structure
DSA ciphers always use DH key exchange and need DH-parameters
Both halves must usually by handled by the same application thread
This meant that `` clone '' digests such as EVP_dss1_APIName needed to be used to sign using SHA1 and DSA
SSL_new_APIName creates a new SSL_new_APIParam_1 structure which is needed to hold the data for a TLS/SSL connection
The OpenSSL library uses your callback function to help implement a common TLS ticket construction state according to RFC5077 Section 4 such that per session state is unnecessary and a small set of cryptographic variables needs to be maintained by the callback function implementation
It should be noted , that inclusion of a cipher to be used into the list is a necessary condition
Due to the modular nature of the ENGINE API , pointers to ENGINEs need to be treated as handles - ie not only as pointers , but also as references to the underlying ENGINE object
On a related note , those auditing code should pay special attention to any instances of DECLARE/IMPLEMENT _ LHASH_DOALL _ -LSB- ARG _ -RSB- _ FN macros that provide types without any `` const '' qualifiers
It should also be noted that many ENGINE API function calls that accept a structural reference will internally obtain another reference - typically this happens whenever the supplied ENGINE will be needed by OpenSSL after the function has returned
This behaviour ensures that each callback is called at most once and that an application can never send unsolicited extensions
Each successful call to RSA_get_ex_new_index will return an index greater than any previously returned , this is important
the certificate will never be used
no freeing of the results is necessary
Currently there are two supported flags BN_BLINDING_NO_UPDATE and BN_BLINDING_NO_RECREATE
This functions behaves in a similar way to CMS_sign except the flag values CMS_DETACHED , CMS_BINARY , CMS_NOATTR , CMS_TEXT and CMS_STREAM are not supported
SSL_set_current_cert also supports the option SSL_CERT_SET_SERVER
This functions behaves in a similar way to CMS_verify except the flag values CMS_DETACHED , CMS_BINARY , CMS_TEXT and CMS_STREAM are not supported
The lack of support for BIO_puts_APIName and the non standard behaviour of BIO_gets_APIName could be regarded as anomalous
Because of the format of base64 encoding , the end of the encoded block can not always be reliably determined
Be careful to avoid small subgroup attacks
application developers are not expected to implement it , but to compile provided module with compiler of their choice and link it into the target application
the signed content must all be held in memory
another socket can not be bound to the same port
This code will result in buf apparently containing garbage
New applications should use the SHA2 digest algorithms such as SHA256
Do not use the TLSv1 .2 protocol
this is likely to be very inefficient
the callback must provide some random data to psk and return the length of the random data, so the connection will fail with decryption_error before the connection will be finished completely
The validity of the certificate and its trust level has to be checked by other means
an error occurs
A non-recoverable , fatal error in the SSL library occurred , usually a protocol error
A failure can occur
the behaviour is undefined
This `` reuse '' capability is present for historical compatibility but its use is strongly discouraged
The first thing to consider is whether the programmer wishes to make alternative ENGINE modules available to the application and user
The ok parameter to the callback indicates the value the callback should return to retain the default behaviour
 SSL_rstate_string_APIName should always return "RD"/"read done"
The actual length of the password must be returned to the calling function
The callback should return 0
The callback should return a positive value
As the reference counter is not incremented , the return value of SSL_get0_session_APIName is only valid
The returned pointer must not be freed by the calling application
The deleted entry is returned and must be freed up
Applications should check the return value before printing out any debugging information relating to the current certificate
That means that there is no limit on the size of the numbers manipulated by these functions, but return values must always be checked in case a memory allocation error has occurred
Some of the return values are ambiguous and care should be taken
Applications must not free the return value
It is recommended, to check the return value of SSL_shutdown_APIName and call SSL_shutdown_APIName again
In general it cannot be assumed that the data returned by ASN1_STRING_data_APIName is null terminated or does not contain embedded nulls
The value returned by that TLS/SSL I/O function must be passed to SSL_get_error_APIName in parameter SSL_get_error_APIParam_2 SSL_get_error_APIParam_2
Applications which could pass invalid NIDs to X509_NAME_get_index_by_NID_APIName should check for the return value of -2
The value returned is an internal pointer which must not be freed
Applications must check for return value on error
The EVP_PKEY_CTX value returned must not be freed directly by the application
It returns an index which should be stored and passed used in the RSA_set_ex_data_APIParam_2 RSA_get_ex_data_APIParam_2 parameter in the remaining functions
EVP_PKEY_get0_hmac, EVP_PKEY_get0_poly1305, EVP_PKEY_get0_siphash, EVP_PKEY_get0_RSA, EVP_PKEY_get0_DSA, EVP_PKEY_get0_DH and EVP_PKEY_get0_EC_KEY also return the referenced key in EVP_PKEY_get0_hmac_APIParam_1 EVP_PKEY_get0_poly1305_APIParam_1 EVP_PKEY_get0_siphash_APIParam_1 EVP_PKEY_get0_RSA_APIParam_1 EVP_PKEY_get0_DSA_APIParam_1 EVP_PKEY_get0_DH_APIParam_1 EVP_PKEY_get0_EC_KEY_APIParam_1 or NULL if the key is not of the correct type but the reference count of the returned key is not incremented and so must not be freed up after use
callback should return 1 to indicate verification success and 0 to indicate verification failure
the callback function should return 2
In general a verification callback should NOT unconditionally return 1 in all circumstances
the PKCS7_sign_add_signer_APIParam0 is not complete and must be finalized either by streaming or a call to PKCS7_final
the returned CMS_ContentInfo structure is not complete and must be finalized either by streaming or a call to CMS_final
The return value should always be checked goto err
the callback MUST return 1
The callback should return a negative value on error
The callback must return 0 if The callback cannot generate a session id for whatever reason and return 1 on success
Otherwise or on errors callback should return 0
Callback functions should return 1 on success or 0 on error
As a result EVP_PKEY_size_APIName would have to return a value which indicates the maximum possible signature for any set of parameters

However , new applications should not typically use this
These functions will typically be called after a failed BIO_read_APIName or BIO_write_APIName call
This function does not work on RSA public keys that have only the modulus and public exponent elements populated
This can only be accomplished by either adding the intermediate CA certificates into the trusted certificate store for the SSL_CTX object , or by adding the chain certificates using the SSL_CTX_add_extra_chain_cert_APIName function , which is only available for the SSL_CTX object as a whole and that probably can only apply for one client certificate , making the concept of the callback function questionable
The above functions should be used to manipulate verification parameters instead of legacy functions which work in specific structures such as X509_STORE_CTX_set_flags_APIName
it must be freed at some point after the operation
The pseudo-random number generator must be seeded prior to calling RSA_generate_key_ex
