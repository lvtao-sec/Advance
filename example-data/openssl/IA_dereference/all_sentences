These functions apply to SSL/TLS servers only
If the data is to be kept, SSL_get1_session_APIName will increment the reference count, so that the session will not be implicitly removed by other operations but stays in memory
Always check the error return value of RAND_bytes_APIName and RAND_priv_bytes_APIName and do not take randomness for granted: an error occurs if the CSPRNG has not been seeded with enough randomness to ensure an unpredictable byte sequence
One way to do this is to set the prefix to an appropriate value using SSL_CONF_CTX_set1_prefix_APIName, pass the current argument to SSL_CONF_cmd_value_type_APIParam_2 SSL_CONF_cmd_APIParam_2 and the following argument to SSL_CONF_cmd_APIParam_3 (which may be NULL)

When these conditions are not met for any cipher in the list (eg a client only supports export RSA ciphers with a asymmetric key length of 512 bits and the server is not configured to use temporary RSA keys), the "no shared cipher" (SSL_R_NO_SHARED_CIPHER) error is generated and the handshake will fail
Due to the protocol definition, a TLS/SSL server will always send a certificate, if present
SSL_free_APIName decrements the reference count of SSL_free_APIParam_1, and removes the SSL structure pointed to by SSL_free_APIParam_1 and frees up the allocated memory if the reference count has reached 0

If d2i_ECPKParameters_APIParam_1 is not NULL , d2i_ECPKParameters_APIParam_0  is written to d2i_ECPKParameters_APIParam_1 If d2i_ECPKParameters_APIParam_1 is not NULL, then it is assumed that d2i_ECPKParameters_APIParam_1 contains a valid d2i_ECPKParameters_APIParam_1 structure and an attempt is made to reuse it
(See the BUGS section.)
SSL_CTX_set_mode_APIName adds the mode set via bitmask in SSL_CTX_set_mode_APIParam_2 to SSL_CTX_set_mode_APIParam_1
These functions implement RSA public key encryption and signatures as defined in PKCS #1 v2.0 [RFC 2437]
The reference count is 1, so that the session must be explicitly removed using SSL_SESSION_free_APIName , unless the SSL_SESSION object is completely taken over, when being called inside the get_session_cb_APIName (see SSL_CTX_sess_set_get_cb_APIName )
Typically BIO_CLOSE is used in a source/sink BIO to indicate that the underlying I/O stream should be closed when the BIO is freed

It should only be called after the initial handshake has been completed
SSL_set_rfd_APIName and SSL_set_wfd_APIName perform the respective action, but only for the read channel or the write channel, which can be set independently
 returns the cipher BIO method.
 sets the field name of ne to obj .
If no ENGINE API functions are called at all in an application, then there are no inherent memory leaks to worry about from the ENGINE functionality, however if any ENGINEs are loaded, even if they are never registered or used, it is necessary to use the ENGINE_cleanup_APIName function to correspondingly cleanup before program exit, if the caller wishes to avoid memory leaks
Note that this function is only defined for TLSv1.0 and above, and DTLSv1.0 and above
MD4_Init(), , MD4_Final(), MD5_Init(), MD5_Update(), and MD5_Final() are analogous using an MD4_CTX and MD5_CTX structure.

 returns a pointer to the current default DSA_METHOD.
When decrypting the final block is checked to see if the final block has the correct form
The way this password can be supplied may depend on the application
This behaviour can also be changed; if the ENGINE_TABLE_FLAG_NOINIT flag is set (using ENGINE_set_table_flags_APIName), no attempted initialisations will take place, instead the only way for the state table to return a non-NULL ENGINE to the "get_default" query will be if one is expressly set in the table
The default depth limit is 100, allowing for the peer certificate and additional 100 CA certificates
Note that just because a ciphersuite is available (ie it is configured in the cipher list) and shared by both the client and the server it does not mean that it is enabled (for example some ciphers may not be usable by a server if there is not a suitable certificate configured)

In some versions of OpenSSL the "reuse" behaviour of d2i_X509_APIName when d2i_X509_APIParam_1 is valid is broken and some parts of the reused structure may persist if some parts of the reused structure are not present in the new one
This is often undesirable however because the accept BIO will still accept additional incoming connections
This function simply wraps calls to EC_KEY_new and EC_GROUP_new_by_curve_name

On the client side, the inclusion into the list is also sufficient
This type should be considered opaque and fields should not be modified or accessed directly
If a server wishes to process multiple connections (as is normally the case) ,then the accept BIO must be made available for further incoming connections
A TLSCiphertext record was received which had a length more than 2^14+2048 bytes, or a record decrypted to a TLSCompressed record with more than 2^14+1024 bytes

The body of the record is being evaluated
It will not be reset by calling SSL_clear_APIName
Applications should use the higher level functions EVP_DigestInit_APIName etc instead of calling the hash functions directly

When performing a transparent negotiation using SSL_write_APIName or SSL_read_APIName , the handshake routines must be explicitly set in advance using either SSL_set_connect_state_APIName or SSL_set_accept_state_APIName
If the PKCS7_sign_add_signer_APIParam_4 parameter is NULL ,then the default digest for the public key algorithm will be used
If the underlying file descriptor is in a non blocking mode ,then the BIO will behave in the manner described in the BIO_read_APIName and BIO_should_retry_APIName manual pages
 closes down an SSL connection on BIO chain bio .
However, if the user is expected to know which ENGINE device he/she is using (in the case of specialised hardware, this goes without saying) then applications may not need to concern themselves with discovering the supported control commands and simply prefer to pass settings into ENGINEs exactly as they are provided by the user
If the simple configuration function OPENSSL_config_APIName is called , then OPENSSL_load_builtin_modules_APIName is called automatically
The  function performs a public key encryption operation using ctx .
Not all BIOs support these calls
(SSL/TLS server only.)
 clears any existing chain associated with the current certificate of ctx .
 adds the options set via bitmask in options to ssl .
 writes num bytes from the buffer buf into the specified ssl connection.
This has several potential uses, it can be used to cache data associated with a structure (for example the hash of some part of the structure) or some additional data (for example a handle to the data in an external library)
BN_ calls bn_mul_normal(), or an optimized implementation if the factors have the same size: bn_mul_comba8() is used if they are 8 words long, bn_mul_recursive() if they are larger than BN_MULL_SIZE_NORMAL and the size is an exact multiple of the word size, and bn_mul_part_recursive() for others that are larger than BN_MULL_SIZE_NORMAL .

EVP_cleanup_APIName removes all ciphers and digests from the table
BIO_new_fd_APIName returns a file descriptor BIO using BIO_new_fd_APIParam_1 and BIO_new_fd_APIParam_2
The behaviour of SSL_connect_APIName depends on the underlying BIO
Typically a callback would obtain an OCSP_RESPONSE object from this data via a call to the d2i_OCSP_RESPONSE_APIName function
, OBJ_ln2nid(), OBJ_sn2nid() return the corresponding NID for the object o , the long name <ln> or the short name <sn> respectively or NID_undef if an error occurred.

The  function is initially called to "register" some new application specific data.
The prefix "i2d" is arguably wrong because the function outputs BER format
This is because the code then becomes transparent to the digest used and much more flexible
Thus, SSL_get_error_APIName must be used in the same thread that performed the TLS/SSL I/O operation, and no other OpenSSL function calls should appear in between

By generating a temporary DH key inside the server application that is lost when the application is left, it becomes impossible for an attacker to decrypt past sessions, even if he gets hold of the normal (certified) key, as this key was only used for signing
During its use, an SSL objects passes several states
In a setup where attackers can measure the time of RSA decryption or signature operations, blinding must be used to protect the RSA operation from that attack
Calling BIO_reset_APIName on a accept BIO will close any active connection and reset the BIO into a state where it awaits another incoming connection

 enables/disables session caching by setting the operational mode for ctx to <mode>.
The information must therefore only be used for normal operation under non-blocking I/O
It is also possible for the application to dynamically interrogate the loaded ENGINE implementations for the names, descriptions, and input flags of their available "control commands", providing a more flexible configuration scheme
(Certificate files might be encrypted as well from the technical point of view, it however does not make sense as the data in the certificate is considered public anyway.)
If the actual time is later than creation time plus timeout, the session is not reused

If any of these algorithms is not available then it will not be included: for example the GOST algorithms will not be included if the GOST ENGINE is not loaded
BIO_free_APIName frees up a single BIO, BIO_vfree_APIName also frees up a single BIO but it does not return a value
The callback when used on the client side should return a negative value on error; 0 if the response is not acceptable (in which case the handshake will fail) or a positive value if it is acceptable
This indicates an error
 extracts and decrypts the content from a PKCS#7 envelopedData structure.
EC_GROUP_get_basis_type returns the values NID_X9_62_tpBasis or NID_X9_62_ppBasis (as defined in <openssl/obj_mac.h>) for a trinomial or pentanomial respectively

Applications can use longer keys to maintain a consistent level of security
f(x) = x^m + x^k + 1 with m > k >= 1
The actual condition for a correctly closed session is SSL_SENT_SHUTDOWN (according to the TLS RFC, it is acceptable to only send the "close notify" alert but to not wait for the peer's answer, when the underlying connection is closed)
BIO_get_cipher_status_APIName is a BIO_ctrl_APIName macro which can be called to determine whether the decryption operation was successful

More complex PKCS#12 files with multiple private keys will only return the first match
SSL objects may be using the SSL_SESSION object; as a session may be reused, several SSL objects may be using one SSL_SESSION object at the same time
SSL_CTX_sess_set_remove_cb_APIName sets the callback function, which is automatically called whenever a session is removed by the SSL engine, because it is considered faulty or the session has become obsolete because of exceeding the timeout value
EVP_PKEY_assign_RSA(), EVP_PKEY_assign_DSA(), , EVP_PKEY_assign_EC_KEY(), EVP_PKEY_assign_POLY1305() and EVP_PKEY_assign_SIPHASH() also set the referenced key to key however these use the supplied key internally and so key will be freed when the parent pkey is freed.
This might occur during a time consuming operation where a user clicks on a "cancel" button
In parallel, the sessions form a linked list which is maintained separately from the lhash_APIName operations, so that the database must not be modified directly but by using the SSL_CTX_add_session_APIName family of functions
The return value can be compared to the macro to make sure that the correct version of the library has been loaded, especially when using DLLs on Windows systems
 signs the message digest m of size m_len using the private key rsa as specified in PKCS #1 v2.0.
MD2(), , and MD5() compute the MD2, MD4, and MD5 message digest of the n bytes at d and place it in md (which must have space for MD2_DIGEST_LENGTH == MD4_DIGEST_LENGTH == MD5_DIGEST_LENGTH == 16 bytes of output).
This is usually worked around by only passing the relevant data to ASN1 functions when the entire structure can be read or written
Only when a record has been completely received, it can be processed (decryption and check of integrity)

This removal is not synchronized with the expiration of sessions
BIO_get_num_renegotiates_APIName returns the total number of session renegotiations due to I/O or timeout
It is therefore recommended, to check the return value of SSL_shutdown_APIName and call SSL_shutdown_APIName again, if the bidirectional shutdown is not yet complete (return value of the first call is 0)
Finally, use UI_process_APIName to actually perform the prompting and UI_get0_result_APIName to find the result to the prompt
If the table is not initialized, several functions will misbehave and complain several functions cannot find algorithms
It should also be noted that many ENGINE API function calls that accept a structural reference will internally obtain another reference - typically this happens whenever the supplied ENGINE will be needed by OpenSSL after the function has returned
SSL_COMP_free_compression_methods_APIName frees the internal table of compression methods that were built internally, and possibly augmented by adding SSL_COMP_add_compression_method_APIName

 returns the SSL BIO method.
The  function will explicitly sign a CMS_SignerInfo structure, its main use is when CMS_REUSE_DIGEST and CMS_PARTIAL flags are both set.
 builds the certificate chain for ctx normally this uses the chain store or the verify store if the chain store is not set.
A fatal alert always leads to a connection abort
All functions can also return -2 if the input is malformed
For signing arbitrary messages, see the EVP_DigestSignInit_APIName and EVP_SignInit_APIName signing interfaces instead

Here we'll assume we want to load and register all ENGINE implementations bundled with OpenSSL, such that for any cryptographic algorithm required by OpenSSL - if there is an ENGINE that implements it and can be initialised, it should be used
 serves two functions.
This means that calls to EVP_VerifyUpdate_APIName and EVP_VerifyFinal_APIName can be called later to digest and verify additional data
d2i_DSAPublicKey_APIName and i2d_DSAPublicKey_APIName decode and encode the DSA public key components structure

 returns a pointer to the ASN1_OCTET_STRING pointer containing the embedded content.
Since the private key is passed in the call to EVP_SignFinal_APIName, any error relating to the private key (for example an unsuitable key and digest combination) will not be indicated until after potentially large amounts of data have been passed through EVP_SignUpdate_APIName
X509_get0_notBefore() and  return the notBefore and notAfter fields of certificate x respectively.
So the first consideration is whether any/all available ENGINE implementations should be made visible to OpenSSL - this is controlled by calling the various "load" functions, eg
Therefore data that was not retrieved at the last call of SSL_read_APIName can still be buffered inside the SSL layer and will be retrieved on the next call to SSL_read_APIName
 changes the UI method associated with a given UI.
Refer to EC_GROUP_new_APIName for a description of curve names
RSA_generate_key works in the same way as RSA_generate_key_ex except it uses "old style" call backs
The PRNG must be seeded prior to using this function (see rand_APIName )
There should be some way of specifying a test that the BIO can perform to reliably determine EOF (for example a MIME boundary)
For example an application might call SSL_CTX_cmd_APIName and if it returns -2 (unrecognised command) continue with processing of application specific commands
HMAC_cleanup_APIName is an alias for HMAC_CTX_cleanup_APIName included for back compatibility with 0.9.6b, it is deprecated

 returns the "quiet shutdown" setting of ctx .
The OpenSSL ASN1 functions cannot gracefully deal with non blocking I/O: that is they cannot retry after a partial read or write
However, this return value should probably be ignored because if it was supplied by an ENGINE, the pointer could be invalidated at any time if the ENGINE is unloaded (in fact it could be unloaded as a result of the RSA_set_method_APIName function releasing its handle to the ENGINE)
All other flags are left in their existing state
X509_VERIFY_PARAM_get_flags_APIName returns the current verification flags
One case where this would be appropriate would be where a server has spawned a process to satisfy a request; the process might receive security parameters (key length, authentication, etc) at startup and it might be difficult to communicate changes to these parameters after that point
The SSL*_set_verify*_APIName functions do not provide diagnostic information
The error can be obtained from ERR_get_error_APIName
