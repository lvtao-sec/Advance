The idea is that two processes with the same machine ID should be able to use shared memory, UNIX domain sockets, process IDs, and other features of the OS that require both processes to be running on the same OS kernel instance. The machine ID can also be used to create unique per-machine instances. For example, you could use it in bus names or X selection names. The machine ID is preferred over the machine hostname, because the hostname is frequently set to ""localhost.localdomain"" and may also change at runtime.

This UUID is guaranteed to remain the same until the next reboot (unless the sysadmin foolishly changes it and screws themselves).

The idea is that two processes with the same machine ID should be able to use shared memory, UNIX domain sockets, process IDs, and other features of the OS that require both processes to be running on the same OS kernel instance. The machine ID can also be used to create unique per-machine instances. For example, you could use it in bus names or X selection names. The machine ID is preferred over the machine hostname, because the hostname is frequently set to ""localhost.localdomain"" and may also change at runtime. You can get the machine ID of a remote application by invoking the method GetMachineId from interface org.freedesktop.DBus.Peer. If the remote application has the same machine ID as the one returned by this function, then the remote application is on the same machine as your application. The UUID is not a UUID in the sense of RFC4122; the details are explained in the D-Bus specification. Returns a 32-byte-long hex-encoded UUID string, or NULL on failure"

For example: To append an array of fixed-length basic types (except Unix file descriptors), pass in the DBUS_TYPE_ARRAY typecode, the element typecode, the address of the array pointer, and a 32-bit integer giving the number of elements in the array. So for example: dbus_message_append_args_APIName does not support arrays of Unix file descriptors. If you need those you need to manually recurse into the array.

The fixed-length types are all basic types that are not string-like. So int32, double, bool, etc. (Unix file descriptors however are not supported.) You must call dbus_message_iter_open_container_APIName to open an array of values before calling this function. You may call dbus_message_iter_append_fixed_array_APIName multiple times (and intermixed with calls to dbus_message_iter_append_basic_APIName ) for the same array. The ""value"" argument should be the address of the array. So for integer, ""dbus_int32_t**"" is expected for example. Warning in C, given ""int array[]"", ""&array == array"" (the comp.lang.c FAQ says otherwise, but gcc and the FAQ do not agree). So if you are using an array instead of a pointer you have to create a pointer variable, assign the array to it, then take the address of the pointer variable. For strings it works to write const char *array = ""Hello"" and then use &array though.

Adds a match dbus_bus_add_match_APIParam_2 to match messages going through the message bus,null,Adds a match dbus_bus_add_match_APIParam_2 to match messages going through the message bus.,"Adds a match dbus_bus_add_match_APIParam_2 to match messages going through the message bus. The ""rule"" argument is the string form of a match dbus_bus_add_match_APIParam_2. If you pass NULL for the dbus_bus_add_match_APIParam_3, dbus_bus_add_match_APIName will not block; the match thus will not be added until you flush the dbus_bus_add_match_APIParam_1, and if there an dbus_bus_add_match_APIParam_3 adding the match you will not find out about it. This is generally acceptable, since the possible errors (including a lack of resources in the bus, the dbus_bus_add_match_APIParam_1 having exceeded its quota of active match rules, or the match dbus_bus_add_match_APIParam_2 being unparseable) are generally unrecoverable. If you pass non- NULL for the dbus_bus_add_match_APIParam_3 dbus_bus_add_match_APIName will block until it gets a reply. This may be useful when using match dbus_bus_add_match_APIParam_2 keys introduced in recent versions of D-Bus, like 'arg0namespace', to allow the application to fall back to less efficient match rules supported by older versions of the daemon if the running version is not new enough; or when using user-supplied rules rather than rules hard-coded at compile time. Normal API conventions would have the function return a boolean value indicating whether the dbus_bus_add_match_APIParam_3 was set, but that would require blocking always to determine the return value. The AddMatch method is fully documented in the D-Bus specification. For quick reference, the format of the match rules is discussed here, but the specification is the canonical version of this information. Rules are specified as a string of comma separated key/value pairs.

A specialised form of wildcard matching on arguments is supported for path-like namespaces. If your argument match has a 'path' suffix (eg: ""arg0path='/some/path/'"") then it is considered a match if the argument exactly matches the given string or if one of them ends in a '/' and is a prefix of the other. Matching on interface is tricky because method call messages only optionally specify the interface.

This is generally acceptable, since the possible errors (including a lack of resources in the bus, the dbus_bus_add_match_APIParam_1 having exceeded its quota of active match rules, or the match dbus_bus_add_match_APIParam_2 being unparseable) are generally unrecoverable.

The AddMatch method is fully documented in the D-Bus specification. For quick reference, the format of the match rules is discussed here, but the specification is the canonical version of this information. Rules are specified as a string of comma separated key/value pairs. An example is ""type=ignal',sender='org.freedesktop.DBus', interface='org.freedesktop.DBus',member='Foo', path='/bar/foo',destination=':452345.34'"" Possible keys you can match on are type, sender, interface, member, path, destination and numbered keys to match message args (keys are 'arg0', 'arg1', etc.). Omitting a key from the dbus_bus_add_match_APIParam_2 indicates a wildcard match. For instance omitting the member from a match dbus_bus_add_match_APIParam_2 but adding a sender would let all messages from that sender through regardless of the member. Matches are inclusive not exclusive so as long as one dbus_bus_add_match_APIParam_2 matches the message will get through. It is important to note this because every time a message is received the application will be paged into memory to process it. This can cause performance problems such as draining batteries on embedded platforms. If you match message args ('arg0', 'arg1', and so forth) only string arguments will match. That is, arg0='5' means match the string ""5"" not the integer 5. Currently there is no way to match against non-string arguments. A specialised form of wildcard matching on arguments is supported for path-like namespaces. If your argument match has a 'path' suffix (eg: ""arg0path='/some/path/'"") then it is considered a match if the argument exactly matches the given string or if one of them ends in a '/' and is a prefix of the other. Matching on interface is tricky because method call messages only optionally specify the interface. If a message omits the interface, then it will NOT match if the dbus_bus_add_match_APIParam_2 specifies an interface name. This means match rules on method calls should not usually give an interface. However, signal messages are required to include the interface so when matching signals usually you should specify the interface in the match dbus_bus_add_match_APIParam_2. For security reasons, you can match arguments only up to DBUS_MAXIMUM_MATCH_RULE_ARG_NUMBER . Match rules have a maximum length of DBUS_MAXIMUM_MATCH_RULE_LENGTH bytes.

A specialised form of wildcard matching on arguments is supported for path-like namespaces. If your argument match has a 'path' suffix (eg: ""arg0path='/some/path/'"") then it is considered a match if the argument exactly matches the given string or if one of them ends in a '/' and is a prefix of the other. Matching on interface is tricky because method call messages only optionally specify the interface. If a message omits the interface, then it will NOT match if the dbus_bus_add_match_APIParam_2 specifies an interface name. This means match rules on method calls should not usually give an interface.

This method is fully documented in the D-Bus specification,null,This method is fully documented in the D-Bus specification.,"Asks the bus to assign the given dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 to this dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_1 by invoking the RequestName method on the bus. This method is fully documented in the D-Bus specification. For quick reference, the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3 and result codes are discussed here, but the specification is the canonical version of this information. First you should know that for each bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2, the bus stores a queue of connections that would like to own it. Only one owns it at a time - called the primary owner. If the primary owner releases the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 or disconnects, then the next owner in the queue atomically takes over. So for example if you have an application org.freedesktop.TextEditor and multiple instances of it can be run, you can have all of them sitting in the queue. The first one to start up will receive messages sent to org.freedesktop.TextEditor, but if that one exits another will become the primary owner and receive messages. The queue means you do not need to manually watch for the current owner to disappear and then request the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 again. When requesting a dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2, you can specify several dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3. DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT and DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE are properties stored by the bus for this dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_1 with respect to each requested bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2. These properties are stored even if the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_1 is queued and does not become the primary owner. You can update these dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3 by calling RequestName again (even if you already own the name). DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT means that another requestor of the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 can take it away from you by specifying DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING . DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE means that if you are not the primary owner, you do not want to be queued up - you only care about being the primary owner. Unlike the other two dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3, DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING is a property of the individual RequestName call, i.e. the bus does not persistently associate it with the connection-name pair. If a RequestName call includes the DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING flag, and the current primary owner has DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT set, then the current primary owner will be kicked off. If no dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3 are given, an application will receive the requested dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 only if the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 is currently unowned; and it will NOT give up the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 if another application asks to take it over using DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING . dbus_bus_request_name_APIName returns a result code. The possible result codes are as follows. DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_PRIMARY_OWNER means that the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 had no existing owner, and the caller is now the primary owner; or that the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 had an owner, and the caller specified DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING , and the current owner specified DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT . DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_IN_QUEUE happens only if the caller does NOT specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE and either the current owner did NOT specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT or the caller did NOT specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING . In this case the caller ends up in a queue to own the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 after the current owner gives it up. DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_EXISTS happens if the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 has an owner already and the caller specifies DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE and either the current owner has NOT specified DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT or the caller did NOT specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING . DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_ALREADY_OWNER happens if an application requests a dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 it already owns. (Re-requesting a dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 is useful if you want to change the DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT or DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE settings.) When a service represents an application, say ""text editor,"" then it should specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT if it wants the last editor started to be the user editor vs. the first one started. Then any editor that can be the user editor should specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING to either take over (last-started-wins) or be queued up (first-started-wins) according to whether DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT was given. Conventionally, single-instance applications often offer a command line option called –replace which means to replace the current instance. To implement this, always set DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT when you request your application bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2. When you lose ownership of your bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2, you need to exit. Look for the signal ""NameLost"" from DBUS_SERVICE_DBUS and DBUS_INTERFACE_DBUS (the signal first argument is the bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 that was lost). If starting up without –replace, do not specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING , and exit if you fail to become the bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 owner. If –replace is given, ask to replace the old owner. dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_1 is the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_1. dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 is the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 to request. dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3 is dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3. dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_4 is location to store the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_4. dbus_bus_request_name_APIName return a result code, -1 if dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_4 is set"

If you use dbus_bus_get_APIName or dbus_bus_get_private_APIName dbus_bus_register_APIName will be called for you. Note Just use dbus_bus_get_APIName or dbus_bus_get_private_APIName instead of dbus_bus_register_APIName and save yourself some pain. Using dbus_bus_register_APIName manually is only useful if you have your own custom message bus not found in DBusBusType . If you open a bus dbus_bus_register_APIParam_1 with dbus_connection_open_APIName or dbus_connection_open_private_APIName you will have to dbus_bus_register_APIName yourself, or make the appropriate registration method calls yourself. If you send the method calls yourself, call dbus_bus_set_unique_name_APIName with the unique bus name you get from the bus. For shared connections (created with dbus_connection_open_APIName ) in a multithreaded application, you can not really make the registration calls yourself, because you do not know whether some other thread is also registering, and the bus will kick you off if you send two registration messages. If you use dbus_bus_register_APIName however, there is a lock that keeps both apps from registering at the same time. The rule in a multithreaded app, then, is that dbus_bus_register_APIName must be used to register, or you need to have your own locks that all threads in the app will respect. In a single-threaded application you can register by hand instead of using dbus_bus_register_APIName , as long as you check dbus_bus_get_unique_name_APIName to see if a unique name has already been stored by another thread before you send the registration messages. dbus_bus_register_APIParam_1 is the dbus_bus_register_APIParam_1. dbus_bus_register_APIParam_2 is place to store errors. dbus_bus_register_APIName return TRUE on success"

This method is fully documented in the D-Bus specification. For quick reference, the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3 and result codes are discussed here, but the specification is the canonical version of this information. First you should know that for each bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2, the bus stores a queue of connections that would like to own it. Only one owns it at a time - called the primary owner. If the primary owner releases the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 or disconnects, then the next owner in the queue atomically takes over. So for example if you have an application org.freedesktop.TextEditor and multiple instances of it can be run, you can have all of them sitting in the queue. The first one to start up will receive messages sent to org.freedesktop.TextEditor, but if that one exits another will become the primary owner and receive messages. The queue means you do not need to manually watch for the current owner to disappear and then request the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 again. When requesting a dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2, you can specify several dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3. DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT and DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE are properties stored by the bus for this dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_1 with respect to each requested bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2. These properties are stored even if the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_1 is queued and does not become the primary owner. You can update these dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3 by calling RequestName again (even if you already own the name). DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT means that another requestor of the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 can take it away from you by specifying DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING . DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE means that if you are not the primary owner, you do not want to be queued up - you only care about being the primary owner. Unlike the other two dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3, DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING is a property of the individual RequestName call, i.e. the bus does not persistently associate it with the connection-name pair. If a RequestName call includes the DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING flag, and the current primary owner has DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT set, then the current primary owner will be kicked off. If no dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3 are given, an application will receive the requested dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 only if the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 is currently unowned; and it will NOT give up the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 if another application asks to take it over using DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING . dbus_bus_request_name_APIName returns a result code. The possible result codes are as follows. DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_PRIMARY_OWNER means that the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 had no existing owner, and the caller is now the primary owner; or that the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 had an owner, and the caller specified DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING , and the current owner specified DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT . DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_IN_QUEUE happens only if the caller does NOT specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE and either the current owner did NOT specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT or the caller did NOT specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING . In this case the caller ends up in a queue to own the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 after the current owner gives it up. DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_EXISTS happens if the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 has an owner already and the caller specifies DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE and either the current owner has NOT specified DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT or the caller did NOT specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING . DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_ALREADY_OWNER happens if an application requests a dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 it already owns. (Re-requesting a dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 is useful if you want to change the DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT or DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE settings.) When a service represents an application, say ""text editor,"" then it should specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT if it wants the last editor started to be the user editor vs. the first one started. Then any editor that can be the user editor should specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING to either take over (last-started-wins) or be queued up (first-started-wins) according to whether DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT was given. Conventionally, single-instance applications often offer a command line option called –replace which means to replace the current instance. To implement this, always set DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT when you request your application bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2. When you lose ownership of your bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2, you need to exit. Look for the signal ""NameLost"" from DBUS_SERVICE_DBUS and DBUS_INTERFACE_DBUS (the signal first argument is the bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 that was lost). If starting up without –replace, do not specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING , and exit if you fail to become the bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 owner.

Unlike the other two dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3, DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING is a property of the individual RequestName call, i.e. the bus does not persistently associate it with the connection-name pair. If a RequestName call includes the DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING flag, and the current primary owner has DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT set, then the current primary owner will be kicked off. If no dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3 are given, an application will receive the requested dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 only if the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 is currently unowned; and it will NOT give up the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 if another application asks to take it over using DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING . dbus_bus_request_name_APIName returns a result code.

DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_IN_QUEUE happens only if the caller does NOT specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE and either the current owner did NOT specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT or the caller did NOT specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING . In this case the caller ends up in a queue to own the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 after the current owner gives it up. DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_EXISTS happens if the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 has an owner already and the caller specifies DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE and either the current owner has NOT specified DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT or the caller did NOT specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING . DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_ALREADY_OWNER happens if an application requests a dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 it already owns. (Re-requesting a dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 is useful if you want to change the DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT or DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE settings.) When a service represents an application, say ""text editor,"" then it should specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT if it wants the last editor started to be the user editor vs. the first one started. Then any editor that can be the user editor should specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING to either take over (last-started-wins) or be queued up (first-started-wins) according to whether DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT was given. Conventionally, single-instance applications often offer a command line option called –replace which means to replace the current instance. To implement this, always set DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT when you request your application bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2. When you lose ownership of your bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2, you need to exit.

First you should know that for each bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2, the bus stores a queue of connections that would like to own it. Only one owns it at a time - called the primary owner. If the primary owner releases the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 or disconnects, then the next owner in the queue atomically takes over. So for example if you have an application org.freedesktop.TextEditor and multiple instances of it can be run, you can have all of them sitting in the queue. The first one to start up will receive messages sent to org.freedesktop.TextEditor, but if that one exits another will become the primary owner and receive messages. The queue means you do not need to manually watch for the current owner to disappear and then request the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 again. When requesting a dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2, you can specify several dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3.

First you should know that for each bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2, the bus stores a queue of connections that would like to own it. Only one owns it at a time - called the primary owner. If the primary owner releases the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 or disconnects, then the next owner in the queue atomically takes over. So for example if you have an application org.freedesktop.TextEditor and multiple instances of it can be run, you can have all of them sitting in the queue. The first one to start up will receive messages sent to org.freedesktop.TextEditor, but if that one exits another will become the primary owner and receive messages. The queue means you do not need to manually watch for the current owner to disappear and then request the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 again. When requesting a dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2, you can specify several dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3. DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT and DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE are properties stored by the bus for this dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_1 with respect to each requested bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2. These properties are stored even if the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_1 is queued and does not become the primary owner. You can update these dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3 by calling RequestName again (even if you already own the name). DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT means that another requestor of the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 can take it away from you by specifying DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING . DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE means that if you are not the primary owner, you do not want to be queued up - you only care about being the primary owner. Unlike the other two dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3, DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING is a property of the individual RequestName call, i.e. the bus does not persistently associate it with the connection-name pair. If a RequestName call includes the DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING flag, and the current primary owner has DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT set, then the current primary owner will be kicked off. If no dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3 are given, an application will receive the requested dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 only if the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 is currently unowned; and it will NOT give up the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 if another application asks to take it over using DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING . dbus_bus_request_name_APIName returns a result code. The possible result codes are as follows. DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_PRIMARY_OWNER means that the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 had no existing owner, and the caller is now the primary owner; or that the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 had an owner, and the caller specified DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING , and the current owner specified DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT . DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_IN_QUEUE happens only if the caller does NOT specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE and either the current owner did NOT specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT or the caller did NOT specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING . In this case the caller ends up in a queue to own the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 after the current owner gives it up. DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_EXISTS happens if the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 has an owner already and the caller specifies DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE and either the current owner has NOT specified DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT or the caller did NOT specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING . DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_ALREADY_OWNER happens if an application requests a dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 it already owns. (Re-requesting a dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 is useful if you want to change the DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT or DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE settings.) When a service represents an application, say ""text editor,"" then it should specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT if it wants the last editor started to be the user editor vs. the first one started. Then any editor that can be the user editor should specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING to either take over (last-started-wins) or be queued up (first-started-wins) according to whether DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT was given. Conventionally, single-instance applications often offer a command line option called –replace which means to replace the current instance. To implement this, always set DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT when you request your application bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2. When you lose ownership of your bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2, you need to exit. Look for the signal ""NameLost"" from DBUS_SERVICE_DBUS and DBUS_INTERFACE_DBUS (the signal first argument is the bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 that was lost). If starting up without –replace, do not specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING , and exit if you fail to become the bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 owner. If –replace is given, ask to replace the old owner. dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_1 is the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_1. dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 is the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 to request. dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3 is dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3. dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_4 is location to store the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_4. dbus_bus_request_name_APIName return a result code, -1 if dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_4 is set"

When a service represents an application, say ""text editor,"" then it should specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT if it wants the last editor started to be the user editor vs. the first one started. Then any editor that can be the user editor should specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING to either take over (last-started-wins) or be queued up (first-started-wins) according to whether DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT was given. Conventionally, single-instance applications often offer a command line option called –replace which means to replace the current instance. To implement this, always set DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT when you request your application bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2. When you lose ownership of your bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2, you need to exit. Look for the signal ""NameLost"" from DBUS_SERVICE_DBUS and DBUS_INTERFACE_DBUS (the signal first argument is the bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 that was lost). If starting up without –replace, do not specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING , and exit if you fail to become the bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 owner. If –replace is given, ask to replace the old owner. dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_1 is the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_1. dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 is the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 to request. dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3 is dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3. dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_4 is location to store the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_4. dbus_bus_request_name_APIName return a result code, -1 if dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_4 is set"

This method is fully documented in the D-Bus specification. For quick reference, the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3 and result codes are discussed here, but the specification is the canonical version of this information. First you should know that for each bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2, the bus stores a queue of connections that would like to own it. Only one owns it at a time - called the primary owner. If the primary owner releases the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 or disconnects, then the next owner in the queue atomically takes over. So for example if you have an application org.freedesktop.TextEditor and multiple instances of it can be run, you can have all of them sitting in the queue. The first one to start up will receive messages sent to org.freedesktop.TextEditor, but if that one exits another will become the primary owner and receive messages. The queue means you do not need to manually watch for the current owner to disappear and then request the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 again. When requesting a dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2, you can specify several dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3. DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT and DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE are properties stored by the bus for this dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_1 with respect to each requested bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2. These properties are stored even if the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_1 is queued and does not become the primary owner. You can update these dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3 by calling RequestName again (even if you already own the name). DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT means that another requestor of the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 can take it away from you by specifying DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING . DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE means that if you are not the primary owner, you do not want to be queued up - you only care about being the primary owner. Unlike the other two dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3, DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING is a property of the individual RequestName call, i.e. the bus does not persistently associate it with the connection-name pair. If a RequestName call includes the DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING flag, and the current primary owner has DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT set, then the current primary owner will be kicked off. If no dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3 are given, an application will receive the requested dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 only if the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 is currently unowned; and it will NOT give up the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 if another application asks to take it over using DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING . dbus_bus_request_name_APIName returns a result code. The possible result codes are as follows. DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_PRIMARY_OWNER means that the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 had no existing owner, and the caller is now the primary owner; or that the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 had an owner, and the caller specified DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING , and the current owner specified DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT .

In this case the caller ends up in a queue to own the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 after the current owner gives it up. DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_EXISTS happens if the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 has an owner already and the caller specifies DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE and either the current owner has NOT specified DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT or the caller did NOT specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING .

If no dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3 are given, an application will receive the requested dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 only if the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 is currently unowned; and it will NOT give up the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 if another application asks to take it over using DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING . dbus_bus_request_name_APIName returns a result code. The possible result codes are as follows. DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_PRIMARY_OWNER means that the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 had no existing owner, and the caller is now the primary owner; or that the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 had an owner, and the caller specified DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING , and the current owner specified DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT . DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_IN_QUEUE happens only if the caller does NOT specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE and either the current owner did NOT specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT or the caller did NOT specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING . In this case the caller ends up in a queue to own the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 after the current owner gives it up. DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_EXISTS happens if the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 has an owner already and the caller specifies DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE and either the current owner has NOT specified DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT or the caller did NOT specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING . DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_ALREADY_OWNER happens if an application requests a dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 it already owns. (Re-requesting a dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 is useful if you want to change the DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT or DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE settings.) When a service represents an application, say ""text editor,"" then it should specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT if it wants the last editor started to be the user editor vs. the first one started. Then any editor that can be the user editor should specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING to either take over (last-started-wins) or be queued up (first-started-wins) according to whether DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT was given. Conventionally, single-instance applications often offer a command line option called –replace which means to replace the current instance. To implement this, always set DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT when you request your application bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2. When you lose ownership of your bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2, you need to exit. Look for the signal ""NameLost"" from DBUS_SERVICE_DBUS and DBUS_INTERFACE_DBUS (the signal first argument is the bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 that was lost). If starting up without –replace, do not specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING , and exit if you fail to become the bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 owner.

This method is fully documented in the D-Bus specification. For quick reference, the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3 and result codes are discussed here, but the specification is the canonical version of this information. First you should know that for each bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2, the bus stores a queue of connections that would like to own it. Only one owns it at a time - called the primary owner. If the primary owner releases the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 or disconnects, then the next owner in the queue atomically takes over. So for example if you have an application org.freedesktop.TextEditor and multiple instances of it can be run, you can have all of them sitting in the queue. The first one to start up will receive messages sent to org.freedesktop.TextEditor, but if that one exits another will become the primary owner and receive messages. The queue means you do not need to manually watch for the current owner to disappear and then request the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 again. When requesting a dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2, you can specify several dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3. DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT and DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE are properties stored by the bus for this dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_1 with respect to each requested bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2. These properties are stored even if the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_1 is queued and does not become the primary owner. You can update these dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3 by calling RequestName again (even if you already own the name). DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT means that another requestor of the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 can take it away from you by specifying DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING . DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE means that if you are not the primary owner, you do not want to be queued up - you only care about being the primary owner. Unlike the other two dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3, DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING is a property of the individual RequestName call, i.e. the bus does not persistently associate it with the connection-name pair. If a RequestName call includes the DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING flag, and the current primary owner has DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT set, then the current primary owner will be kicked off. If no dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3 are given, an application will receive the requested dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 only if the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 is currently unowned; and it will NOT give up the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 if another application asks to take it over using DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING . dbus_bus_request_name_APIName returns a result code. The possible result codes are as follows. DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_PRIMARY_OWNER means that the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 had no existing owner, and the caller is now the primary owner; or that the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 had an owner, and the caller specified DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING , and the current owner specified DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT .

In this case the caller ends up in a queue to own the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 after the current owner gives it up. DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_EXISTS happens if the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 has an owner already and the caller specifies DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE and either the current owner has NOT specified DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT or the caller did NOT specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING . DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_ALREADY_OWNER happens if an application requests a dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 it already owns. (Re-requesting a dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 is useful if you want to change the DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT or DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE settings.) When a service represents an application, say ""text editor,"" then it should specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT if it wants the last editor started to be the user editor vs. the first one started. Then any editor that can be the user editor should specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING to either take over (last-started-wins) or be queued up (first-started-wins) according to whether DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT was given. Conventionally, single-instance applications often offer a command line option called –replace which means to replace the current instance. To implement this, always set DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT when you request your application bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2. When you lose ownership of your bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2, you need to exit.

DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_IN_QUEUE happens only if the caller does NOT specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE and either the current owner did NOT specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT or the caller did NOT specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING . In this case the caller ends up in a queue to own the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 after the current owner gives it up. DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_EXISTS happens if the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 has an owner already and the caller specifies DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE and either the current owner has NOT specified DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT or the caller did NOT specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING . DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_ALREADY_OWNER happens if an application requests a dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 it already owns. (Re-requesting a dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 is useful if you want to change the DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT or DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE settings.) When a service represents an application, say ""text editor,"" then it should specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT if it wants the last editor started to be the user editor vs. the first one started. Then any editor that can be the user editor should specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING to either take over (last-started-wins) or be queued up (first-started-wins) according to whether DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT was given. Conventionally, single-instance applications often offer a command line option called –replace which means to replace the current instance. To implement this, always set DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT when you request your application bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2. When you lose ownership of your bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2, you need to exit.

This method is fully documented in the D-Bus specification. For quick reference, the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3 and result codes are discussed here, but the specification is the canonical version of this information. First you should know that for each bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2, the bus stores a queue of connections that would like to own it. Only one owns it at a time - called the primary owner. If the primary owner releases the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 or disconnects, then the next owner in the queue atomically takes over. So for example if you have an application org.freedesktop.TextEditor and multiple instances of it can be run, you can have all of them sitting in the queue. The first one to start up will receive messages sent to org.freedesktop.TextEditor, but if that one exits another will become the primary owner and receive messages. The queue means you do not need to manually watch for the current owner to disappear and then request the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 again. When requesting a dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2, you can specify several dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3.

These properties are stored even if the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_1 is queued and does not become the primary owner. You can update these dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3 by calling RequestName again (even if you already own the name). DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT means that another requestor of the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 can take it away from you by specifying DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING . DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE means that if you are not the primary owner, you do not want to be queued up - you only care about being the primary owner. Unlike the other two dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3, DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING is a property of the individual RequestName call, i.e. the bus does not persistently associate it with the connection-name pair. If a RequestName call includes the DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING flag, and the current primary owner has DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT set, then the current primary owner will be kicked off.

If the primary owner releases the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 or disconnects, then the next owner in the queue atomically takes over. So for example if you have an application org.freedesktop.TextEditor and multiple instances of it can be run, you can have all of them sitting in the queue. The first one to start up will receive messages sent to org.freedesktop.TextEditor, but if that one exits another will become the primary owner and receive messages. The queue means you do not need to manually watch for the current owner to disappear and then request the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 again. When requesting a dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2, you can specify several dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3. DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT and DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE are properties stored by the bus for this dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_1 with respect to each requested bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2. These properties are stored even if the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_1 is queued and does not become the primary owner. You can update these dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3 by calling RequestName again (even if you already own the name). DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT means that another requestor of the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 can take it away from you by specifying DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING . DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE means that if you are not the primary owner, you do not want to be queued up - you only care about being the primary owner. Unlike the other two dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3, DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING is a property of the individual RequestName call, i.e. the bus does not persistently associate it with the connection-name pair. If a RequestName call includes the DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING flag, and the current primary owner has DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT set, then the current primary owner will be kicked off. If no dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3 are given, an application will receive the requested dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 only if the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 is currently unowned; and it will NOT give up the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 if another application asks to take it over using DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING . dbus_bus_request_name_APIName returns a result code. The possible result codes are as follows. DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_PRIMARY_OWNER means that the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 had no existing owner, and the caller is now the primary owner; or that the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 had an owner, and the caller specified DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING , and the current owner specified DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT . DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_IN_QUEUE happens only if the caller does NOT specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE and either the current owner did NOT specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT or the caller did NOT specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING . In this case the caller ends up in a queue to own the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 after the current owner gives it up. DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_EXISTS happens if the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 has an owner already and the caller specifies DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE and either the current owner has NOT specified DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT or the caller did NOT specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING . DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_ALREADY_OWNER happens if an application requests a dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 it already owns. (Re-requesting a dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 is useful if you want to change the DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT or DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE settings.) When a service represents an application, say ""text editor,"" then it should specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT if it wants the last editor started to be the user editor vs. the first one started. Then any editor that can be the user editor should specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING to either take over (last-started-wins) or be queued up (first-started-wins) according to whether DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT was given. Conventionally, single-instance applications often offer a command line option called –replace which means to replace the current instance. To implement this, always set DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT when you request your application bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2. When you lose ownership of your bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2, you need to exit. Look for the signal ""NameLost"" from DBUS_SERVICE_DBUS and DBUS_INTERFACE_DBUS (the signal first argument is the bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 that was lost). If starting up without –replace, do not specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING , and exit if you fail to become the bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 owner. If –replace is given, ask to replace the old owner. dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_1 is the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_1. dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 is the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 to request. dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3 is dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3. dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_4 is location to store the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_4. dbus_bus_request_name_APIName return a result code, -1 if dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_4 is set"

(Re-requesting a dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 is useful if you want to change the DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT or DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE settings.) When a service represents an application, say ""text editor,"" then it should specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT if it wants the last editor started to be the user editor vs. the first one started. Then any editor that can be the user editor should specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING to either take over (last-started-wins) or be queued up (first-started-wins) according to whether DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT was given. Conventionally, single-instance applications often offer a command line option called –replace which means to replace the current instance. To implement this, always set DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT when you request your application bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2. When you lose ownership of your bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2, you need to exit. Look for the signal ""NameLost"" from DBUS_SERVICE_DBUS and DBUS_INTERFACE_DBUS (the signal first argument is the bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 that was lost). If starting up without –replace, do not specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING , and exit if you fail to become the bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 owner. If –replace is given, ask to replace the old owner. dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_1 is the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_1. dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 is the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 to request. dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3 is dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3. dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_4 is location to store the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_4. dbus_bus_request_name_APIName return a result code, -1 if dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_4 is set"

This method is fully documented in the D-Bus specification. For quick reference, the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3 and result codes are discussed here, but the specification is the canonical version of this information. First you should know that for each bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2, the bus stores a queue of connections that would like to own it. Only one owns it at a time - called the primary owner. If the primary owner releases the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 or disconnects, then the next owner in the queue atomically takes over. So for example if you have an application org.freedesktop.TextEditor and multiple instances of it can be run, you can have all of them sitting in the queue. The first one to start up will receive messages sent to org.freedesktop.TextEditor, but if that one exits another will become the primary owner and receive messages. The queue means you do not need to manually watch for the current owner to disappear and then request the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 again. When requesting a dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2, you can specify several dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3. DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT and DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE are properties stored by the bus for this dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_1 with respect to each requested bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2. These properties are stored even if the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_1 is queued and does not become the primary owner. You can update these dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3 by calling RequestName again (even if you already own the name). DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT means that another requestor of the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 can take it away from you by specifying DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING . DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE means that if you are not the primary owner, you do not want to be queued up - you only care about being the primary owner. Unlike the other two dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3, DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING is a property of the individual RequestName call, i.e. the bus does not persistently associate it with the connection-name pair. If a RequestName call includes the DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING flag, and the current primary owner has DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT set, then the current primary owner will be kicked off. If no dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3 are given, an application will receive the requested dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 only if the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 is currently unowned; and it will NOT give up the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 if another application asks to take it over using DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING . dbus_bus_request_name_APIName returns a result code. The possible result codes are as follows. DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_PRIMARY_OWNER means that the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 had no existing owner, and the caller is now the primary owner; or that the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 had an owner, and the caller specified DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING , and the current owner specified DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT . DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_IN_QUEUE happens only if the caller does NOT specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE and either the current owner did NOT specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT or the caller did NOT specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING . In this case the caller ends up in a queue to own the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 after the current owner gives it up. DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_EXISTS happens if the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 has an owner already and the caller specifies DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE and either the current owner has NOT specified DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT or the caller did NOT specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING .

The only reason to use dbus_bus_set_unique_name_APIName is to re-implement the equivalent of dbus_bus_register_APIName yourself.

There really no point creating pain for yourself by doing things manually. it is hard to use dbus_bus_set_unique_name_APIName safely on shared connections (created by dbus_connection_open_APIName ) in a multithreaded application, because only one registration attempt can be sent to the bus.

This method is fully documented in the D-Bus specification. For quick reference, the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3 and result codes are discussed here, but the specification is the canonical version of this information. First you should know that for each bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2, the bus stores a queue of connections that would like to own it. Only one owns it at a time - called the primary owner. If the primary owner releases the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 or disconnects, then the next owner in the queue atomically takes over. So for example if you have an application org.freedesktop.TextEditor and multiple instances of it can be run, you can have all of them sitting in the queue. The first one to start up will receive messages sent to org.freedesktop.TextEditor, but if that one exits another will become the primary owner and receive messages. The queue means you do not need to manually watch for the current owner to disappear and then request the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 again. When requesting a dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2, you can specify several dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3. DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT and DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE are properties stored by the bus for this dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_1 with respect to each requested bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2. These properties are stored even if the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_1 is queued and does not become the primary owner. You can update these dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3 by calling RequestName again (even if you already own the name). DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT means that another requestor of the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 can take it away from you by specifying DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING . DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE means that if you are not the primary owner, you do not want to be queued up - you only care about being the primary owner. Unlike the other two dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3, DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING is a property of the individual RequestName call, i.e. the bus does not persistently associate it with the connection-name pair. If a RequestName call includes the DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING flag, and the current primary owner has DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT set, then the current primary owner will be kicked off. If no dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3 are given, an application will receive the requested dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 only if the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 is currently unowned; and it will NOT give up the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 if another application asks to take it over using DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING . dbus_bus_request_name_APIName returns a result code. The possible result codes are as follows. DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_PRIMARY_OWNER means that the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 had no existing owner, and the caller is now the primary owner; or that the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 had an owner, and the caller specified DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING , and the current owner specified DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT . DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_IN_QUEUE happens only if the caller does NOT specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE and either the current owner did NOT specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT or the caller did NOT specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING . In this case the caller ends up in a queue to own the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 after the current owner gives it up. DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_EXISTS happens if the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 has an owner already and the caller specifies DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE and either the current owner has NOT specified DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT or the caller did NOT specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING . DBUS_REQUEST_NAME_REPLY_ALREADY_OWNER happens if an application requests a dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 it already owns. (Re-requesting a dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 is useful if you want to change the DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT or DBUS_NAME_FLAG_DO_NOT_QUEUE settings.) When a service represents an application, say ""text editor,"" then it should specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT if it wants the last editor started to be the user editor vs. the first one started. Then any editor that can be the user editor should specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING to either take over (last-started-wins) or be queued up (first-started-wins) according to whether DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT was given. Conventionally, single-instance applications often offer a command line option called –replace which means to replace the current instance. To implement this, always set DBUS_NAME_FLAG_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT when you request your application bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2. When you lose ownership of your bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2, you need to exit. Look for the signal ""NameLost"" from DBUS_SERVICE_DBUS and DBUS_INTERFACE_DBUS (the signal first argument is the bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 that was lost). If starting up without –replace, do not specify DBUS_NAME_FLAG_REPLACE_EXISTING , and exit if you fail to become the bus dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 owner. If –replace is given, ask to replace the old owner. dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_1 is the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_1. dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 is the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_2 to request. dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3 is dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_3. dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_4 is location to store the dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_4. dbus_bus_request_name_APIName return a result code, -1 if dbus_bus_request_name_APIParam_4 is set"
