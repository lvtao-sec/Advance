The format of the link-layer header is indicated by the return value of the pcap_datalink_APIName routine when handed the pcap_t value also passed to pcap_loop_APIName or pcap_dispatch_APIName. https://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes.html lists the values pcap_datalink_APIName can return and describes the packet formats that correspond to those values. The value pcap_next_ex_APIName returns will be valid for all packets received unless and until pcap_set_datalink_APIName is called; after a successful call to pcap_set_datalink_APIName, all subsequent packets will have a link-layer header of the type specified by the link-layer header type value passed to pcap_set_datalink"
