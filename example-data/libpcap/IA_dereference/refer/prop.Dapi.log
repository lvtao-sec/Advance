One can use options PCAP_TSTAMP_PRECISION_MICRO and PCAP_TSTAMP_PRECISION_NANO to request desired precision
desired precision, pcap_set_tstamp_precision

and PCAP_TSTAMP_PRECISION_NANO should be specified if the packets to be written have time stamps in seconds and nanoseconds
have time stamps, pcap_tstamp_type_name_to_val

In previous releases , there is no support for appending packets to an existing savefile
existing savefile, pcap_file

If NULL be returned by pcap_dump_open_APIName, pcap_geterr_APIName can be used to get the error text
get the error text, pcap_geterr

We recommend always setting the timeout to a non-zero value unless immediate mode is set , in which case the timeout has no effect
mode is set, pcap_set_rfmon

you must use or copy the string before closing the pcap_t
closing the pcap_t, pcap_close

The list of devices must be freed with pcap_freealldevs_APIName , which frees the list pointed to by alldevs
frees the list, pcap_freealldevs

Monitor mode was specified but the capture source does not support monitor mode
Monitor mode was specified, pcap_can_set_rfmon
